This document introduces a user-friendly password generator application developed in Python using the Tkinter library. The application aims to help users create secure passwords tailored to their needs by allowing them to specify the number of passwords and their respective lengths. By leveraging randomization techniques, the application generates passwords that incorporate a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers, enhancing their complexity and security.

Users can easily interact with the application through a graphical interface, where they can input their desired number of passwords and lengths. The application includes validation checks to ensure that all inputs meet minimum requirements, such as enforcing a minimum password length of six characters. Once the passwords are generated, they are displayed in a scrollable text area for easy viewing.

This password generator not only simplifies the process of creating strong passwords but also promotes better security practices among users who may struggle with remembering complex combinations. By automating password creation, the application serves as a practical tool for anyone looking to enhance their online security effortlessly. Overall, this project highlights the importance of secure password management in todayâ€™s digital world and provides an accessible solution for users of all technical backgrounds.
